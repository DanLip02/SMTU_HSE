# SMTU_HSE
This repository contains implementations and simulations for solving Riccati equations in optimal control problems. It includes numerical methods for finite and infinite horizon cases, state-space simulations, and visualizations of optimal control strategies.

ðŸ“‚ Jupyter Notebooks:

[Task_1.ipynb](https://github.com/DanLip02/SMTU_HSE/jupyter/Task_1.ipynb) â€“ Riccati equation solution and system response analysis.

The repository is structured for reproducibility, version control, and efficient collaboration on computational experiments.
